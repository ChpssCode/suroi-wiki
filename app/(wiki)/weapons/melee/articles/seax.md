The **Seax** is a melee weapon added in the v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14, 2024.

# Background

The Seax is a large single-edged blade with a tang in the centerline of the blade, inserted into an organic hilt either made by wood or horn. It is typically used for hunting and fighting.

# Strategies

## Using 
 - Make sure to time your shots well as missing one can be fatal.
 - Think of the Seax as a buffed [Baseball Bat](/weapons/melee/baseball_bat)

## Countering

- As with all melee weapons, the best way to avoid them entirely is to keep your distance and use a gun designed for mid or long range combat to kill them.
- Use a high-dps weapon like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) to shoot down the Seax user approaching you if you can't escape.
 

# Obtaining

The Seax can only be obtained the [Viking Chest](/obstacles/viking_chest). One [Viking Chest](/obstacles/viking_chest) spawns near the coast each game.

# Trivia
